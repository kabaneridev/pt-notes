# Introduction

Client-side authorization enforcement refers to security measures implemented in the client's browser (e.g., JavaScript) to control user access to resources or functionalities. While client-side controls can improve user experience by providing immediate feedback and reducing unnecessary server requests, they are inherently insecure as they can be easily bypassed by a determined attacker. This module will explore common client-side authorization enforcement mechanisms and how to bypass them to gain unauthorized access.

## The Problem with Client-Side Authorization

Client-side authorization relies on the client to enforce access rules. However, attackers can manipulate client-side code, modify HTTP requests, or use developer tools to bypass these controls. Since the client environment is not trusted, any authorization logic implemented solely on the client side is vulnerable.

Key reasons why client-side authorization is insecure:

*   **Client-side code manipulation:** Attackers can modify JavaScript, HTML, or CSS to enable disabled features or access hidden elements.
*   **HTTP request tampering:** Tools like Burp Suite can intercept and modify requests before they reach the server, bypassing any client-side checks.
*   **Lack of server-side validation:** If server-side validation is absent or weak, client-side bypasses will lead to successful unauthorized actions.

## Common Client-Side Authorization Mechanisms

This module will cover various client-side authorization enforcement techniques, including:

*   **UI Element Manipulation:** Hiding or disabling buttons, links, or entire sections of a web page based on user roles.
*   **JavaScript-based Access Control:** Using JavaScript logic to check permissions before making API calls or performing actions.
*   **Hidden Form Fields:** Relying on hidden input fields to convey authorization information, which can be easily modified.
*   **API Key/Token Storage in Client-Side:** Storing sensitive API keys or tokens in local storage or cookies that are accessible client-side.
*   **URL-based Access Control (Client-side):** Relying on client-side routing or URL parameters to enforce access, which can be directly manipulated.

## Exploitation Strategy

The general strategy for bypassing client-side authorization involves:

1.  **Identify client-side controls:** Analyze the web application's front-end code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and network requests to understand how authorization is enforced.
2.  **Bypass UI restrictions:** Use browser developer tools to enable disabled elements, unhide hidden sections, or modify client-side scripts.
3.  **Intercept and modify requests:** Use proxy tools (e.g., Burp Suite) to intercept HTTP requests and modify parameters or headers to bypass authorization checks.
4.  **Test for server-side vulnerabilities:** Even after bypassing client-side controls, always test for corresponding server-side vulnerabilities (e.g., IDOR, privilege escalation) to confirm the full impact.

By understanding these principles, you can effectively identify and exploit weaknesses in client-side authorization enforcement.
